# Dot Files yeeeeee
I basically had a setup that I loved, got a new computer than realized all setup stuff was on my other machine. I didn't want to port everything over so I built this little repo, it's not the greatest, but I'm happy with it and it does what it needs to. A lot of my inspiration for this came from [mathiasbynens/dotfiles] as well as [holman/dotfiles]. If you have time check those guys out, they both have amazing dot file configurations and hopefully mine will be as good as theirs! â™¥

##### Use at your own risk!
To install everything:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:djowinz/dot-files.get && cd dot-files
chmod a+x scripts/install.sh && scripts/install.sh
```

The installation will walk you through a serious of questions and will even backup your old settings. Even so, please still make a manual backup of your files before attempting this as it will overwrite specific files that may not be accounted for in the script.

I will eventually create a global installation for linux as well. This is only meant for max os x as it uses brew, but since I've found Linuxbrew to be almost exactly like Mac OS X's brew It should expidite this tremendously.

## Lastly...
I really encourage feedback pull request, I want to make this better and I know it takes a village to raise a baby. Seeing how this baby is in it's infancy I look largely to people to give me constructive criticism and feedback. I haven't done everything perfect here, but it's my valiant attempt to simplify and streamline my setup.

#### Todos
##### Installation script(s)
 - Implement system detection to determine which install script to use.
 - Implement linux / BSD install script file.
 - Seperate install functions commands into functions to simplify the script
 - Improve back up detection so when running the script files aren't removed unintentionally unbeknownst to the user.
 - Improve prompt sectinos, so that certian pieces can be either installed / not installed.
##### Organization
 - Make the directory structure more topical, so that each directory servers a single purpose. For one ensure that the zsh directory is solely responsible for zsh methods.
 - Generate a .functions script on install that concatenates all function/*.bash files into one.
 - Improve symlink system so that symlinks can be autocompiled at initialization.
