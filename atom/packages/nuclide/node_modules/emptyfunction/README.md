# emptyFunction (NodeJS)

Nothing but an empty function closure.

Primarily Intended for optional closures. This allows you to use one empty closure object in your entire project, and whenever you need it, you can just pass it by reference instead of creating a new closure.

## install

    npm install emptyfunction
    
## usage

Get the closure from the module

    var emptyFunction = require('emptyfunction');

Whenever there's an optional closure, just add the empty function if no closure is provided
    
    function MyClass(closureArgument) {
        if (typeof closureArgument === "function") {
            this.someFunction = closureArgument
        } else {
            this.someFunction = emptyFunction;
        }
    }

Write your class as if the function exists

    MyClass.prototype.doSomething = function() {
        this.someFunction();
    }
    
## identifying

Sometimes you might need to verify if the closure is an empty function.

If you're inside the same package you can use:

    this.someFunction === emptyFunction

If not, a more hacky solution is to use:    

    this.someFunction.name === 'emptyFunction'
